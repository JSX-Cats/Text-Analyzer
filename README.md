Text-Analyzer
=============

Takes text as input  and returns an analysis of the text.
Just a junk python script at the moment. Probably might turn into a language processor.

Update 0:
returns the parts of speech in the file sample.txt located on the same directory.

Update 1: --pending
 - Returns Parts of Speech(POS) in JSON
 - Text input on index.html
